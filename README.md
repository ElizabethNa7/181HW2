First, the sample code from Lecture 25, Tensorflow-introduction (CMPE-Tensorflow1.ipynb) was downloaded, and all of it's code was ran and observed.

Then, a TensorFlow Kaggle tutorial was followed to lightly familiarize myself some of the basics of Tensorflow, such as sessions, activation functions, and optimisers. A session encapsulates the environment that operation objects are executed and tensor objects are evaluated and an activation function scales the output of a node given an input or input set.

After that, option 2 of topic 2 is done and images are classified. I imported dataset.py file from my Google Drive, loaded the data, used a helper function to plot images and write their predicted classes, plotted images, a function to perform optimization iterations, a function for misclassified errors, a function to plot a confusion matrix, and a function to show the performance and classification accuracy.
